Now that you understand the fundamentals, it's time to develop the skills that separate struggling beginners from effective builders.

These five chapters teach you the practical techniques:

- How to break down overwhelming tasks
- How to write prompts that actually work
- How to communicate when things go wrong
- How to give AI the information it needs
- How to know when to cut your losses

These aren't abstract concepts—they're practical skills you'll use in every coding session.
