  <h1>Part 4: Code Literacy</h1>
  <p>Understanding code without becoming a programmer.</p>
</div>

You don't need to become a programmer. But some basic code literacy makes everything easier.

These five chapters give you just enough understanding to:

- Read code without panicking
- Recognize common patterns
- Understand what AI gives you
- Verify that code does what you expect

Think of it like learning to read a foreign language well enough to navigate, even if you can't write poetry in it.
