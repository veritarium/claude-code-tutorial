  <h1>Part 1: Foundations</h1>
  <p>The mental models. Understand these and everything else makes sense.</p>
</div>

This is where it all begins. Before you write a single prompt, you need to understand how this partnership works.

These three chapters establish the mental framework you'll use for everything else. They answer the fundamental questions:

- What is my role versus AI's role?
- How does the work actually flow?
- What are all the things I can do?

Master these concepts and you'll have a solid foundation for everything that follows.
