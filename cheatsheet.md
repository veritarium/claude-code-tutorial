## What's Included

### The Core Partnership
**YOU + AI = BUILDER**
- You provide: Direction, judgment, domain knowledge
- AI provides: Code, speed, syntax knowledge

### The Loop
**DESCRIBE → GET → RUN → EVALUATE → REPEAT**

### Six Operations
1. **CREATE** - Make something new
2. **READ** - Understand existing code
3. **EDIT** - Change existing code
4. **RUN** - Execute and see results
5. **FIX** - Debug errors
6. **EXTEND** - Add features

### The One-Sentence Rule
If you can't explain the task in one sentence, break it down further.

### Five Components of a Good Prompt
1. **WHAT** - What you want created
2. **WHERE** - Language, file, context
3. **HOW** - Specific approach or formula
4. **WHY** - Purpose (helps AI make decisions)
5. **EXAMPLE** - Sample input/output

### Feedback Formula
**"Got X, Expected Y, Change Z"**
- I got [actual result]
- I expected [what you wanted]
- Please change [specific thing]

### The 5-Attempt Rule
Stuck after 5 tries? Start fresh.
- New conversation
- Rephrase the problem
- Break into smaller pieces

### Common Error Types
- **Syntax Error** - Typo, check spelling and brackets
- **Name Error** - Variable doesn't exist
- **Type Error** - Wrong data type (string vs number)
- **Index Error** - List position doesn't exist

### When Stuck
1. Ask AI with full context
2. Search the error online
3. Rephrase the question
4. Break into smaller parts
