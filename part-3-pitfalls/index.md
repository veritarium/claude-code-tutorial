  <h1>Part 3: Problems</h1>
  <p>What goes wrong and how to fix it.</p>
</div>

Things will go wrong. That's not a failure—it's a normal part of the process.

These three chapters prepare you for the inevitable problems:

- The traps that catch everyone (and how to avoid them)
- How to debug errors systematically
- Escape routes when you're completely stuck

The difference between giving up and succeeding often comes down to knowing these patterns.
